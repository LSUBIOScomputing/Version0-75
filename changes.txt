Desired: Add bounds on optimization (but he wants linear constraints)

Fixed: Problem with checking for independent correlation structure when alpha is a vector of length > 1

ANOTHER PROBLEM:  fm1 <- geem(resp ~ age * smoke, id=id, data = ohio, family = binomial,
	corstr = "ar1")

:> QIC(fm1)
#Error in fitted.geem(xi) : could not find function "InvLink"
